# Useful Tips

   The NC_Council_Heat_Map.ipynb(NC_Council) file can be seen in nbviewer by clicking the link in the icon to the upper right. It visualizes the 
call volume by neighborhood council for May 2019.

  The heat_map_and_year_selector.ipynb must be downloaded locally to your machine to be viewed. All the dependencies must be installed
on your machine in order for it to run. This is a very large hassle and will be corrected in the coming weeks so that no download is
needed.

heat_map_and_year_selector.ipynb is an improvement over NC_Council because it allows the user to view call volume for January thru September for 2018 
   and 2019 by neighborhood council. It also allows the user to select an individual neighborhood council.
